# Project: bike-share-rider - [Mohamed Ismail]

# Description
  
  - Simply , It acts as a Predictor for  bike ride sharing depend on data coming from [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
  - in this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up .
  - I used Algorith known as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to train the network.the idea is that for each training pass, you grab a random sample of the data instead of using the whole data set. You use many more training passes than with normal gradient descent, but each pass is much faster. This ends up training the network more efficiently. You'll learn more about SGD later.
